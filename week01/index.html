    <h1>Week 01 Notes</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Before smartphones were popularized, websites and applications only had to be designed for a
        single screen size.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's easier to scale up an application from mobile than it is to scale down from desktop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improving speed and finger reachability on a mobile app are two of the ways you can improve
        user retention and experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using good placement and obvious controls makes it easier for users to engage with your
        application.
      </li>
      <li>
        For mobile forms, include only the essential fields, avoid clutter, use autocomplete, and
        use an appropriate keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>Advertising should be unobtrusive. Put your content first.</li>
    </ul>
