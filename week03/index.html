      <h2>Chapter 5 - Objects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When creating an object literal, you can use square brackets to create a computed property
          name. JS expressions can also be used as the value of a property.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use the <code>in</code> operator to check if a property exists on an object.
          <code>in</code> can also be used to loop through the keys of an object.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can also use the <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> method, which will check if the object
          has a property that has not been inherited.
        </li>
        <li>
          Objects can be passed as parameters to functions. The function can use destructuring to
          choose which properties are used in the function.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>this</code> keyword refers to the object it is inside of. It can be used to
          allow functions inside of an object to access other properties of the object.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 6 - The DOM</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <code>childNodes</code> property of an element returns a NodeList of all the child
          nodes of that element, including text nodes. The <code>children</code> property of an
          element returns a HTMLCollection of all the child elements of that element, excluding text
          nodes. There are also <code>firstChild</code>, <code>lastChild</code>,
          <code>nextSibling</code>, and <code>previousSibling</code> properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Node lists are not arrays, but they can be converted to arrays using the
          <code>Array.from()</code> method, or the spread operator.
        </li>
        <li>
          A DOM node can only exist in one place in the DOM. Using the <code>appendChild()</code> or
          <code>insertBefore()</code> methods will move the node to a different location in the DOM.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 7 - Events</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When handling keyboard events, you can check for keyboard combinations using the event's
          <code>shiftKey</code>, <code>ctrlKey</code>, and <code>altKey</code> properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Click events go through the capturing and bubbling phases. Capturing starts from outside
          in, and bubbling goes from inside out.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use the <code>preventDefault()</code> method to prevent the default action of an
          event.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use the <code>stopPropagation()</code> method to prevent the event from bubbling
          up the DOM tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Event delegation allows you to attach an event listener to a parent element that will
          handle events for any of its child elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>target</code> property of an event object refers to the element that triggered
          the event (child element). The <code>currentTarget</code> property refers to the element
          that is listening for the event (parent element).
        </li>
      </ul>
