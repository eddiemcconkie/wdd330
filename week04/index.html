      <h2>Chapter 8 - Forms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Form <code>input</code> elements have multiple events, such as
          <code>"focus"</code>
          for when the input gains focus,
          <code>"blur"</code>
          for when the input loses focus, and
          <code>"change"</code>
          for when the value of the input changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>autofocus</code> attribute can be used to set the focus to an input
          automatically when the page loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>preventDefault()</code> function can be used to stop the form from being
          submitted.
        </li>
        <li>The <code>required</code> attribute can be used to make an input required.</li>
        <li>
          Forms provide several types of validation by default, but you can implement your own
          validation by modifying the <code>submit</code> event on the form.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>disabled</code> attribute can be used to disable an input or a submit button.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 12 - OOP</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Previously, a constructor function was needed to create objects. ES6 introduced the
          <code>class</code> declaration keyword, which can be used to create classes in a way
          that's similar to other OOP languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          In both cases, the <code>new</code> keyword is used to create an instance of a class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classes can use <code>static</code> methods which belong to the class itself, and not to a
          specific instance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The prototype of a class can be modified after the class has been declared to add new
          methods or properties. (Note: the prototype is "live", so any changes made to the
          prototype will be applied to all instances of the class, even if they have already been
          created.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> method can be used to check if a property belongs to the
          object or if it's inherited from the prototype.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modifying the prototype of an object is risky, since you never know if a method will be
          added in the future. One solution is to create your own subclass of the object using the
          <code>extends</code> keyword, and then modify the subclass.
        </li>
        <li>
          Using the <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> method, you can define a getter and setter
          for a property, which gives you greater control over how the property is assigned.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to avoid using classes, you can use the <code>Object.create()</code> method to
          create a new object that inherits from the prototype of another object.
        </li>
        <li>Returning <code>this</code> makes it possible to chain methods together.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 15 - Modular JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          JavaScript modules have their own global scope, so the only methods that can be called are
          those that are exported using the <code>export</code> keyword.
        </li>
        <li>JavaScript modules can be imported using the <code>import</code> keyword.</li>
        <li>
          <code>Node.js</code> modules (also called <code>Common JS</code> modules) have been around
          longer and use a slightly different syntax than the new ES6 modules.
        </li>
      </ul>
