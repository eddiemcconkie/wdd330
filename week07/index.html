      <h2>Chapter 11 - Further Functions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <code>call</code> method can be used by a function to specify a value for
          <code>this</code>, as well as take in a set of parameters. The <code>apply</code> method
          is similar, but takes in an array of parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Functions are objects, and can have properties defined on them. This can be useful when
          implementing memoization (caching of results).
        </li>
        <li>
          Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are a way to create a function that is
          immediately executed by wrapping the function declaration in parentheses and then invoking
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          IIFE's can be used to create temporary variables that are not accessible outside of the
          function or create a block where strict mode can be used without affecting existing code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Init-time branching allows you to redefine the behavior of a function based on a
          condition, such as whether or not the browser supports a certain API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Promises allow you to wait for a value that will be available later. Promises can be
          chained together using <code>then</code> to specify what should happen when the promise is
          resolved or rejected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> allow you to wait for a promise to resolve
          before continuing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Closures are created by returning a function from another function, where the inner
          function has access to the variables in the outer function. Even after the outer function
          has returned, the inner function still has access to the variables in the outer function.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generator functions are created by using <code>function*</code> and the
          <code>yield</code> keyword. After calling the generator function, the
          <code>next</code> method can be called to get the next value.
        </li>
        <li>Generators work as iterators, and can be used in <code>for-of</code> loops.</li>
        <li>
          Curried functions are higher-order functions that take in multiple arguments. If all
          arguments are provided, the function will behave like normal. If only some of the
          arguments are provided, the function will return a new function that takes in the
          remaining arguments.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Chapter 13 - AJAX</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          AJAX was created to allow webpages to send and receive data from a server without having
          to reload the page. More recently, the <code>fetch</code> API was introduced to perform
          similar requests. The <code>fetch</code> API is promise-based.
        </li>
